Hi User,

See PDF attached below for a mockup / interactions of the P2P Video Chat App you need to implement for your coding assignment.

You will be using Firebase to store user info / call state, you'll be using the OpenTok iOS SDK for p2p video chat.

Multiple pairs of users should be able to do peer-to-peer video chats simultaneously. This means you’ll need to generate OpenTok session ID’s + client tokens dynamically. You can do this either using the OpenTok REST API, or you can set up your own Node.js application server using this GitHub repo to do session / token creation.
