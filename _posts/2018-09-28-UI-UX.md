It is highly similar to the most popular design software Photoshop, but it is a more powerful graphic design tool.
This tool not only provides a wide range of tools but also deliver results that look very professional.
A few advanced features that it provides are stylized vector shapes, 2x zooming export, and infinite zooming.
With an Export All feature present in this vector-based tool, it can export images in all three major formats â€“ PNG, JPG, and PDF.
Sketch combines functionalities from 3 best tools used in design: provides vector logos just like Illustrator, visual designs same as Photoshop, and wireframing similar to one seen in Omnigraffle.
